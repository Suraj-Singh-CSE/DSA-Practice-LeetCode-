# DSA-Practice-LeetCode-

This repository contains my daily **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice** from **LeetCode**. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen algorithmic thinking, and prepare for coding interviews. Each solution is implemented in an optimized and structured manner.  

##  Topics Covered  
- **Arrays & Strings**  
  - Searching, Sorting, Two Pointers, Sliding Window  
- **Linked Lists**  
  - Singly, Doubly, Circular, Fast & Slow Pointers  
- **Stacks & Queues**  
  - Monotonic Stack, Priority Queue, Deque  
- **Recursion & Backtracking**  
  - Subsets, Permutations, N-Queens  
- **Dynamic Programming**  
  - Knapsack, LCS, Fibonacci, Matrix Chain  
- **Trees & Graphs**  
  - BFS, DFS, MST, Dijkstra, Topological Sorting  
- **Bit Manipulation & Math**  
  - XOR tricks, Prime Numbers, GCD/LCM  
- **Greedy Algorithms**  
  - Interval Scheduling, Huffman Coding  

##  Repository Structure  
- **Daily Problems**  
  - Solutions are organized by date/problem name.  
- **Code Files**  
  - Each problem has a well-structured and optimized solution.  
- **Comments & Explanations**  
  - To help understand the approach better.
